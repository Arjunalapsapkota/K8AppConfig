# K8AppConfig
Application configuration for K8s

This repository hosts the app configuration files or k8 manifest files for an example kubernetes cluster. This repository does not host any source code and will only have YAML files. This is to make use of a separate repo for configuration file and this can change independently and irrespective of the source code repo.
